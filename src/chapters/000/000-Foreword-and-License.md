tl;dr: I'm cool with you modifying this document in order to better suit your needs e.g. turning Aling Nena into Farmer Bob, changing the Chrome/Firefox screenshots to Safari, using Swahili instead of Tagalog in the I18n section, etc. What _isn't_ ok is modifying this work in order to sell it, profiting off it while leaving this poor third-word developer to starve. =(
