# Introduction to Ruby on Rails

## What is Ruby on Rails?

[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) (often shortened to _Rails_ or _RoR_) is a web development framework written in the Ruby programming language. Some popular examples of websites using Rails are [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/), [BaseCamp](http://basecamphq.com/), and [GitHub](http://github.com/).

The biggest draw for Rails is the radical improvement in productivity compared to other web application platforms. Rails makes programming web applications easier by making several assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. This allows you to write less code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Longtime Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.

## Prerequisites of this Course

This course assumes that the student is an experienced web developer and is familiar with:

1. Basic web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Web application development: HTTP 1.1, server-side scripting
3. Object-Oriented Programming
4. SQL and RDBMS concepts

This course will focus on the _Rails_ part of _Ruby on Rails_. This means that knowing the [Ruby programming language](http://ruby-lang.org) is not a prerequisite of this course, nor will we dwell too much on the language. We will only discuss just enough Ruby as we go along the lessons â€“ don't worry; you can still do a lot in Ruby on Rails even with limited Ruby knowledge.
Of course, learning Ruby beforehand will help. Here are some suggested sites for learning Ruby:

* [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org)
* [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)

## Required Software

We will be using the following software for this training course:

* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby on Rails 3.2.6
* SQLite 3 or MySQL 5
